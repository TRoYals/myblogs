{{< admonition question "How to switch Hugo environments?" false >}}
Default environments are `development` with `hugo server` and `production` with `hugo`.

Due to limitations in the local `development` environment,
the **comment system**, **CDN** and **fingerprint** will not be enabled in the `development` environment.

You could enable these features with `hugo server -e production`.
